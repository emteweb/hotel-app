# Hotel-App

Application created with the use of React JS and ES6. UI built on top of Bootstrap.
Since there were no CRUD operations to be implemented I used React Context instead of Redux to pass data between the components.
The application is responsive (I guess it works OK on the mobile).
It has been deployed to Heroku server: https://quiet-sands-42133.herokuapp.com/
